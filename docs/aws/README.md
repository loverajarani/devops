This repository contains a basic [AWS Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template created with the aim of using it as a teaching material. 
Useful for understand how, writing sample json files, you can produce an **scalable**, **secure** and **maintainable** stack.

This template is used for the demo that you will find [here](https://speakerdeck.com/smoya/aws-infrastructure-deployment-using-cloudformation#).
